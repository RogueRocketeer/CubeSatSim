The current CubeSatSim hardware is in the v2.0 folder https://github.com/alanbjohnston/CubeSatSim/tree/master/hardware/v2.0.  The folder contains gerbers, schematics, and images of the Main, Battery, and Solar boards.


For information on building the boards, see https://CubeSatSim.org/wiki.

Older beta versions of the hardware are in the other folders and should not be used.
